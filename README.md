# Project Description

This project is an array & array list sorting program. the program features 3 different Algorithms (Bubble sort, Quick sort (both feature time to execute) and Binary Tree sort), as well as  2 Data Structures and 2 Data Types but is able to be take in more Data Types as long as the Data Type has a comparable interface implantation. these features can be access and applied to randomly generated Integers/Character Arrays and Array List via a command line user interface.

# How to use

* Execute the program from the "Main" Class, upon executing the console will print out the menu as shown the image below, any key insert will register in the line below the printed menu press Enter to confirm option selection and a message will be printed confirming your selection.

* After a selection has been made this menu will be printed another selection will need to be made.

* once all selections have been confirmed a message confirming all selections made along with the data structure and data type sorted by the  will be sorted and printed in the lines below

# Known issues

* Binary Tree output to Array at lengths around 10000 outputs a partially sorted Array
* Binary Tree output to Array at sizes around 10000 List outputs a partially sorted Array List
* Binary Tree output does not output multiple entries of characters in sorted Array List or Array
* Binary Tree Time to Execute not functioning properly
